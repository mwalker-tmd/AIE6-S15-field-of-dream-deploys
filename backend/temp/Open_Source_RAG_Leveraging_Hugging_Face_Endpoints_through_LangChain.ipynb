I have a few new posts lined up, so stay tuned!\\nIn the meantime, I wanted to share some of my favorite books from 2022. I know it\\'s already 2023, but I\\'m a bit behind on my reading list, and I wanted to give you a sneak peek into what I\\'ve been enjoying lately.\\nHere are my top picks from 2022:\\n1. \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\" by Taylor Jenkins Reid - This book is a sweeping romance that follows the life of reclusive Hollywood star Evelyn Hugo. It\\'s a beautifully written story about love, identity, and the power of storytelling.\\n2. \"The Last Thing He Told Me\" by Laura Dave - This novel is a mystery/thriller that follows a woman who discovers her husband\\'s dark secrets after his disappearance. It\\'s a gripping page-turner that explores themes of marriage, family, and deception.\\n3. \"The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue\" by V.E. Schwab - This book is a historical fantasy that follows a young woman who makes a deal with a mysterious figure to live forever. It\\'s a beautifully written story about love, loss, and the human condition.\\n4. \"The Family Upstairs\" by Lisa Jewell - This novel is a psychological thriller that follows a young woman who inherits a mansion from a family she\\'s never met.
